We did the bonus points on part 3. Please note that for toggling rotation tracking, we mapped that to the "O" key rather than the "R" key, because the "R" key was already doing something else.

The tab key will not reset to the global origin, but rather a central position in the room that provides a good view of the guard cube.

We have all contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
